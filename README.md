# Steering-Angle-Pedal-Sensors

A subsystem that measures the angle of the steering wheel, accelerator, and brake pedal. These values are sent via the CAN-Bus to other subsystems on the vehicle and the DAS. 
 
## 2024-2025 Design Goals

* Sensors from last year for pedals seem to work well
   * Honeywell RTY-XXX-LVNAX
   * There are also other alternatives online like those from Piher
   * Piher has been contacted about a sponsorship
* Need to determine a solution for steering angle
