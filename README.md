# Steering-Angle-Pedal-Sensors

A subsystem that measures the angle of the steering wheel, accelerator, and brake pedal. These values are sent via the CAN-Bus to other subsystems on the vehicle and the DAS. 
 
# 2024-2025 Design Goals

* Sensors from last year for pedals seem to work well
* Need to determine a solution for steering angle
