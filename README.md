# Steering-Angle-Pedal-Sensors

A subsystem that measures the angle of the steering wheel, accelerator, and brake pedal. These values are sent via the CAN-Bus to other subsystems on the vehicle and the DAS. 
 
## 2024-2025 Design Goals

* Use [PSC360G2-F2AA-C0002-ERA360-05K](https://www.newark.com/amphenol-piher-sensorscontrols/psc360g2-f2aa-c0002-era360-05k/mag-rotary-angle-position-sensor/dp/71AC5626) from Newark Electronics (roughly $15)
   * This specific model has the following parameters:
      * Redundant Output
          * Analogic Output
          * One goes 90% to 10% voltage output from 0 degrees to 360 degrees
          * Other output goes 10% to 90% voltage output from 0 degrees to 360 degrees
      * 360 Degrees sensing range
      * 5V Opearting Voltage
